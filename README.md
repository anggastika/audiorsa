# Voice Signal Encryption using RSA
MATLAB program to encrypt/decrypt audio files using RSA

Before running the code put the audio file to be encrypted in the same directory as the code files and change the first line of the file "encryption.m" to match the file name of the audio file to be encrypted

Please follow this order while running the programs
1. Run code_gen.m
2. Run encryption.m
3. Run decryption.m

Wavesurfer can be used to analyze and play the audio file. It can be downloaded from the following link.
